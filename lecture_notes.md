## Week 2
## Executive Summary: Variable Classification, Summary Statistics, and Inferential Decision Rules

### 1. Variable Classification
A variable must exhibit variation across cases. Classify variables first by type—Qualitative (Categorical) vs. Quantitative (Numeric)—and then by scale of measurement: Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, or Ratio. This classification guides appropriate statistical procedures.

![Variable classification hierarchy and scales of measurement.](images/figure1.png)

**Examples:**
- Number of votes → Quantitative, Ratio (meaningful zero).
- Highest degree achieved → Qualitative, Ordinal.
- Men’s pants sizes → Quantitative, Ratio.
- Women’s jeans sizes → Qualitative, Ordinal (labels; inconsistent numeric steps).
- Language proficiency → Depends on measurement instrument (numeric test score vs. categorical level).

### 2. Summary Statistics

**Key measures and formulas (plain text):**
- Mean (arithmetic average): `x̄ = (1/n) * Σ(xᵢ)`
- Median: middle value when ordered; for even `n`, median = `(x_(n/2) + x_(n/2+1))/2`
- Sample variance: `s^2 = Σ(xᵢ - x̄)^2 / (n - 1)`
- Sample standard deviation: `s = √(s^2)`
- Population variance: `σ^2 = Σ(xᵢ - μ)^2 / n`
- Skewness (Fisher–Pearson): `g1 = m3 / s^3`, where `m3 = mean((x - x̄)^3)`
- Excess kurtosis (Fisher): `g2 = m4 / s^4 - 3`, where `m4 = mean((x - x̄)^4)`

![Histogram visualizing distribution, central mass, and skew.](images/figure2.png)

![Boxplot highlighting median, quartiles, and potential outliers.](images/figure3.png)

#### Worked Example: Computing Summary Statistics and a 95% CI for the Mean
Given a sample (`n = 200`), we compute:
- Sample mean (`x̄`) = **52.144**
- Sample median = **51.411**
- Sample variance (`s^2`) = **145.968**
- Sample std. dev. (`s`) = **12.082**
- Skewness (`g1`) ≈ **0.827**
- Excess kurtosis (`g2`) ≈ **1.340**

**95% Confidence Interval for the mean (normal approximation):** `CI = x̄ ± z_(0.975) * SE(x̄)`, where `SE(x̄) = s/√n`, `z_(0.975) = 1.96`  
**Result:** `[50.470, 53.819]`

### 3. Inferential Statistics & Decision Rules
Summary vs. inference: Summary statistics describe a sample; inferential methods test hypotheses and estimate parameters to generalize to populations.

**Hypothesis Testing Framework:**
- `H0` (null): baseline claim (e.g., no difference).
- `H1` (alternative): competing claim.
- **Test statistic**: function of data; compare to reference distribution.
- **Decision rule**: Reject `H0` if *p*-value ≤ `α` or if test statistic exceeds critical value.

**Common procedures by scenario:**
- Two-group mean comparison (DV quantitative, IV categorical with 2 levels): **independent-samples t-test**.
- Multi-group mean comparison (DV quantitative, IV categorical with ≥3 levels): **ANOVA**.
- Association between two quantitative variables: **Pearson correlation**; **simple/multiple linear regression**.
- DV binary: **Logistic regression**; association between categorical variables: **Chi-square test**.

![Decision flow for selecting an analysis based on DV/IV types.](images/figure4.png)

### Worked Example: Choosing a Test
Scenario: Compare average training scores (numeric) between two departments (categorical: A vs. B).  
Classification → **DV quantitative**, **IV categorical (2 levels)** ⇒ **independent-samples t-test**.  
Decision rule (`α = 0.05`): reject `H0` if `t > t_crit` or `p-value ≤ 0.05`.

#### 4. Practical Guidance
Focus on conceptual correctness: choose procedures that match variable type and scale. Deviations from standard heuristics can be justified if intentional and principled.

**Checklist:** confirm variables, identify scales, specify DV/IV, choose test via decision rules, inspect assumptions (normality, homoscedasticity, independence).

## Introduction

This lecture introduces two foundational concepts in research methodology: **reliability** and **validity**. While both are central to the quality of scientific measurement, they answer different questions. Reliability concerns **consistency**, whereas validity concerns **truth**—whether a measure actually captures what it claims to measure.

The session revisits familiar ideas, reframes others, and introduces new distinctions that will be important for interpreting results, evaluating studies, and designing sound measures.

---

## Reliability vs. Validity: Core Distinction

### What Is Reliability?

Reliability refers to the **degree of consistency or repeatability** in measurement. A reliable measure yields similar results when:

- Repeated over time  
- Used by different observers  
- Administered using equivalent forms  

In short, reliability asks: *Do we get similar answers each time we measure the same thing?*

### What Is Validity?

Validity refers to the **degree to which a measure reflects the truth**. A valid measure accurately captures the construct it is intended to assess.

Validity asks: *Are we measuring the correct thing?*

### Reliability and Validity Illustrated

A common visualization is a **target diagram**:

- Each dot represents a measurement.
- The bullseye represents the true value.

From this illustration, we can observe four possible situations:

- **Unreliable and invalid:** Measurements are scattered and far from the center.
- **Reliable but invalid:** Measurements cluster tightly but miss the bullseye.
- **Valid but unreliable:** Measurements are spread out but average near the center.
- **Reliable and valid:** Measurements are tightly clustered around the center.

---

## Why Reliability and Validity Matter

The importance of reliability and validity is straightforward:

- We want tools that are **consistent**.
- We want tools that measure **what they are supposed to measure**.

Without reliability, results are unstable. Without validity, results are meaningless—even if they are consistent.

---

## Types of Reliability

When researchers assess reliability, they typically focus on four major types.

---

### Inter‑Rater (Inter‑Observer) Reliability

Inter‑rater reliability concerns **agreement between multiple raters or observers**.

This type of reliability is most relevant when researchers record or code observations, whether in naturalistic settings or laboratory environments.

#### How It Is Calculated

- **Categorical data:**  
  Percentage agreement between raters.
- **Continuous data:**  
  Correlation between raters’ scores.

#### Example: Inter‑Rater Reliability

Two raters evaluate five items.

- **Categorical example:**  
  Reliability is calculated as the proportion of agreements (e.g., 4 out of 5 = 0.80).

- **Continuous example:**  
  Reliability is assessed using Pearson’s correlation (e.g., *r* = 0.83).

> Note: Inter‑rater reliability is vulnerable to threats such as rater drift and inadequate training, which will be addressed in later lessons.

---

### Test–Retest Reliability

Test–retest reliability evaluates **consistency across time**.

The same measure is administered to the same participants at two different time points. High reliability is indicated by stable scores over time.

#### Calculation

- **Categorical variables:** Percentage agreement  
- **Continuous variables:** Correlation between time points

#### Example: Test–Retest Reliability

Participants are measured at Time 1 and Time 2.

- A strong correlation between total scores across time indicates high reliability.
- Low agreement suggests instability in the measurement.

---

### Parallel Forms Reliability

Parallel forms reliability involves creating **equivalent versions of a test**.

#### Procedure

1. Begin with a large pool of items.
2. Divide items into separate forms:
   - Randomly, or
   - Using item characteristics such as difficulty and sensitivity.
3. Treat forms as interchangeable.

A person scoring 10 on Form A should score approximately 10 on Form B.

#### Example: Parallel Forms

Scores from Form 1 and Form 2 are compared across participants.

- High correspondence is expected.
- Low correspondence indicates the forms are not truly equivalent.

Parallel forms reliability is most common in **test construction** and is relatively rare in applied research.

---

### Internal Consistency Reliability

Internal consistency examines **how well items within a single measure relate to one another**.

This is the most common form of reliability reported in psychological research.

#### Average Inter‑Item Correlation

- Compute correlations among all items.
- Average the off‑diagonal correlations.

#### Item–Total (Part–Whole) Correlations

- Correlate each item with the total score.
- Average the resulting correlations.

#### Cronbach’s Alpha

Cronbach’s alpha represents the **average of all possible split‑half reliabilities**.

##### Conceptual Explanation

1. Split items into two halves.
2. Correlate the two total scores.
3. Repeat for all possible splits.
4. Average the results.

Modern statistical software (e.g., R, SPSS, Excel) computes Cronbach’s alpha automatically.

---

## From Reliability to Validity

Reliability is ultimately a **threshold question**: Is consistency “close enough”?

Validity is more complex. It asks a harder question: *Are we measuring what we think we’re measuring?* This makes validity more abstract and, in some cases, unavoidably subjective.

---

## Types of Validity

Validity can be organized into two broad families:

- **Inference‑Based Validity**
- **Construct‑Based Validity**

---

## Inference‑Based Validity

### Internal Validity

Internal validity asks whether the **study design** justifies the conclusions drawn.

Key questions include:

- Were extraneous variables controlled?
- Were alternative explanations ruled out?
- Did the study proceed as planned?

### External Validity

External validity concerns **generalizability**.

It asks whether findings extend:

- Beyond the specific sample
- Beyond the experimental conditions
- To real‑world contexts

---

## Construct‑Based Validity

Construct validity addresses whether a measure meaningfully represents the theoretical construct of interest.

It includes two main categories.

---

### Translational Validity

Translational validities involve subjective judgment.

#### Face Validity

Does the measure *look like* it assesses the intended construct?

#### Content Validity

Does the measure adequately sample the full domain of the construct?

Example:  
A test of intelligence should capture multiple facets—not just a narrow slice.

---

### Criterion Validity

Criterion validity assesses how a measure relates to other variables.

#### Predictive Validity

Does the measure predict outcomes it should theoretically predict?

#### Concurrent Validity

Does the measure correlate with other established measures administered at the same time?

#### Convergent Validity

Does the measure correlate with related constructs it should be associated with?

Example:  
An intelligence measure correlating with academic performance.

#### Discriminant Validity

Does the measure **not** correlate with constructs it should be unrelated to?

Example:  
An intelligence measure correlating with shoe size would indicate a problem.

---

## Interpreting Criterion Validity

Criterion validity relies on **correlations**, but interpretation is nuanced.

There are no absolute thresholds for:

- How large a correlation must be for convergent validity.
- How small a correlation must be for discriminant validity.

Judgment is required to determine whether observed correlations are meaningful or negligible. As a result, validity—unlike reliability—cannot be fully reduced to a single number.

---

## Conclusion

This lecture establishes crucial terminology and conceptual distinctions needed for evaluating measurement quality. While reliability focuses on consistency and offers relatively concrete metrics, validity addresses the deeper question of meaning and truth in measurement.

These foundations will support later discussions of **construct validation** and **critical multiplism**, where multiple traits and methods are used to more rigorously test whether our measures behave as theory predicts.

### Introduction

This lesson explores a seminal approach to construct validation introduced by **Campbell & Fiske (1959)**: the **Multitrait–Multimethod (MTMM) Matrix**. Their work formalized the ideas of **convergent** and **discriminant validity**, motivated the philosophical stance of **critical multiplism**, and highlighted how much “lives inside” any single correlation—namely, contributions from **trait**, **method**, and **error**.

This narrative will:

- Revisit **critical multiplism** and why variance in methods and traits is essential  
- Explain the **MTMM matrix** and the **ideal pattern** of correlations it should reveal  
- Add **LaTeX equations** to unpack why those ideal patterns follow from variance/covariance decomposition  
- Walk through **examples**, including a synthetic illustration and a real empirical application  
- Offer **practical guidance** for using MTMM when validating a measure or inventory  

---

## Critical Multiplism: Why Vary What You Can

**Critical multiplism** argues that researchers should introduce **variance wherever possible**. If it is feasible to vary:

- stimuli  
- methods  
- measures  
- variables  
- hypotheses  

then doing so strengthens scientific inference.

The goal is twofold:

1. **Increase generalizability** by demonstrating that findings hold across different operationalizations.  
2. **Identify boundaries** by learning where results fail to generalize and why.

Rather than relying on a single method or measure, critical multiplism embraces diversity in research design to better understand constructs.

---

## The Multitrait–Multimethod (MTMM) Matrix

Campbell and Fiske proposed the MTMM matrix as a systematic way to evaluate **construct validity**. The matrix is built by:

- Measuring **multiple traits**
- Using **multiple methods**
- Computing all intercorrelations among trait–method combinations

### Core Assumptions

- **Traits should be conceptually independent** (i.e., not highly correlated).
- **Methods should be independent** (i.e., not share systematic variance beyond method effects).

This design allows researchers to:

- Separate **trait variance** from **method variance**
- Evaluate **reliability**, **convergent validity**, and **discriminant validity**
- Identify **method effects** such as response bias or testing format artifacts

---

## Interpreting an MTMM Matrix: Ideal Criteria

### Key Correlation Types

- **Reliability diagonal (mono-trait, mono-method):**  
  Correlations of the same trait measured by the same method (e.g., test–retest, parallel forms), or reported reliability estimates for that trait–method measure.

- **Convergent validity diagonal (mono-trait, hetero-method):**  
  Correlations of the same trait measured using different methods.

- **Heterotrait–heteromethod (HTHM):**  
  Correlations of different traits measured with different methods.

- **Heterotrait–monomethod (HTMM):**  
  Correlations of different traits measured using the same method.

---

### Ideal MTMM Patterns

An ideal MTMM matrix meets the following criteria:

1. **High reliability diagonals**  
   - Reliability correlations should be close to **1.0**, indicating consistent measurement.

2. **Positive convergent validity diagonals**  
   - Same traits measured by different methods should correlate **above zero**.

3. **Ordered magnitudes**  
   - **Reliability > Convergent validity > HTHM correlations**.

4. **Trait dominance over method**  
   - A **trait measured by different methods** should correlate more strongly than **different traits measured by the same method**.

5. **Consistency across hetero-method blocks**  
   - Patterns among hetero-method correlations should be stable; large deviations warrant further investigation.

> **Note:** A verbal slip in the transcript stated reliability diagonals should be “close to zero.” Conceptually, they should be **close to one**.

---

## Why These Patterns Matter: Variance/Correlation Decomposition (with LaTeX)

We can formalize why these patterns are expected by decomposing observed scores into **trait**, **method**, and **error** components.

### Score and Variance Decomposition

Let \( X_{tm} \) denote an observed score for **trait** \( t \) measured by **method** \( m \). Decompose it as:

\[
X_{tm} \;=\; T_t \;+\; M_m \;+\; E_{tm}
\]

The variance of \( X_{tm} \) is:

\[
\mathrm{Var}(X_{tm}) \;=\; \sigma_{T_t}^2 \;+\; \sigma_{M_m}^2 \;+\; \sigma_{E_{tm}}^2 \;+\; 2\,\mathrm{Cov}(T_t, M_m) \;+\; 2\,\mathrm{Cov}(T_t, E_{tm}) \;+\; 2\,\mathrm{Cov}(M_m, E_{tm})
\]

Under the simplifying assumption that **trait**, **method**, and **error** are pairwise uncorrelated:

\[
\mathrm{Var}(X_{tm}) \;=\; \sigma_{T_t}^2 \;+\; \sigma_{M_m}^2 \;+\; \sigma_{E_{tm}}^2
\]

Classical reliability (relative to a latent true score) can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Reliability}(X_{tm}) \;=\; \rho_{X_{tm}X_{tm}} \;=\; \frac{\sigma_{T_t}^2}{\sigma_{T_t}^2 + \sigma_{M_m}^2 + \sigma_{E_{tm}}^2}
\]

In a **test–retest or parallel-forms** setting with the **same method** \( m \), both trait and method components are shared across administrations, so the reliability-type correlation is expected to be highest.

### Convergent Validity (Same Trait, Different Methods)

For two methods \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) measuring the same trait \( t \):

\[
\begin{aligned}
X_{t m_1} &= T_t + M_{m_1} + E_{t m_1} \\
X_{t m_2} &= T_t + M_{m_2} + E_{t m_2}
\end{aligned}
\]

Their covariance is:

\[
\mathrm{Cov}(X_{t m_1}, X_{t m_2}) \;=\; \sigma_{T_t}^2 \;+\; \mathrm{Cov}(M_{m_1}, M_{m_2}) \;+\; \mathrm{Cov}(E_{t m_1}, E_{t m_2})
\]

Assuming independent method and error terms across methods:

\[
\mathrm{Cov}(X_{t m_1}, X_{t m_2}) \;=\; \sigma_{T_t}^2
\]

Hence the **convergent validity correlation** is:

\[
r(X_{t m_1}, X_{t m_2}) \;=\; \frac{\sigma_{T_t}^2}{\sqrt{\mathrm{Var}(X_{t m_1}) \, \mathrm{Var}(X_{t m_2})}}
\]

Because neither method nor error is shared, this correlation is **lower than** same-trait/same-method reliability but **greater than** correlations where neither trait nor method matches.

### Heterotrait–Heteromethod (Different Trait, Different Method)

For different traits \( t_1 \) and \( t_2 \), different methods \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \):

\[
\begin{aligned}
X_{t_1 m_1} &= T_{t_1} + M_{m_1} + E_{t_1 m_1} \\
X_{t_2 m_2} &= T_{t_2} + M_{m_2} + E_{t_2 m_2}
\end{aligned}
\]

Assuming traits are designed to be conceptually independent and method/error components are uncorrelated across traits/methods:

\[
\mathrm{Cov}(X_{t_1 m_1}, X_{t_2 m_2}) \;\approx\; 0
\]

Thus, **HTHM correlations** should be **lowest**, supporting **discriminant validity**.

### Heterotrait–Monomethod (Different Trait, Same Method)

For different traits \( t_1 \), \( t_2 \) with the **same method** \( m \):

\[
\begin{aligned}
X_{t_1 m} &= T_{t_1} + M_{m} + E_{t_1 m} \\
X_{t_2 m} &= T_{t_2} + M_{m} + E_{t_2 m}
\end{aligned}
\]

Their covariance is:

\[
\mathrm{Cov}(X_{t_1 m}, X_{t_2 m}) \;=\; \mathrm{Cov}(T_{t_1}, T_{t_2}) \;+\; \sigma_{M_m}^2 \;+\; \mathrm{Cov}(E_{t_1 m}, E_{t_2 m})
\]

If traits are distinct and errors are uncorrelated, then:

\[
\mathrm{Cov}(X_{t_1 m}, X_{t_2 m}) \;\approx\; \sigma_{M_m}^2
\]

This shows how **shared method variance** can **inflate HTMM correlations**, sometimes making them larger than convergent validities—an empirical warning sign that **method effects** may be dominating.

---

## Example: Synthetic MTMM Matrix (Campbell & Fiske, 1959)

### Example: Idealized Pattern

Campbell and Fiske provide a synthetic MTMM example (often colorized in teaching materials) illustrating ideal patterns:

- **Blue diagonal:** High reliabilities (same trait, same method)  
- **Green cells:** Positive convergent validities (same trait, different methods)  
- **Off-diagonal cells:** Lower correlations reflecting discriminant validity  

**Key takeaways:**

- Reliability correlations are the strongest.  
- Convergent validity correlations are positive and meaningful.  
- HTHM correlations are weakest.  
- Trait effects dominate method effects.  
- Patterns are consistent across hetero-method blocks.

---

## Example: Empirical MTMM Application

### Example: Long, Wong, & Song (2004)

**Observed patterns (as described):**

- **Reliability diagonals (parenthetical values):**  
  Mostly high (e.g., ~0.77–0.78 and above), which is strong by psychological research standards.

- **Convergent validity diagonals (bold values):**  
  Values such as 0.28, 0.34, 0.37, 0.32, 0.20, and 0.34—positive and acceptable.

- **Ordering criterion:**  
  Reliabilities exceed validities, and validities exceed most HTHM correlations.

- **Trait vs. method dominance:**  
  Not fully satisfied. Some heterotrait–monomethod correlations (e.g., ~0.55, ~0.42) exceed convergent validities.

**Interpretation:**

- Elevated HTMM correlations suggest **common method variance**.
- This pattern is common in **individual differences research**, such as personality.
- Further refinement may include:
  - Improving measurement specificity  
  - Adding additional methods  
  - Explicitly modeling method factors  

---

## Practical Guidance: Using MTMM for Validation

### Designing an MTMM Study

- Aim for **at least two traits and two methods**.  
- Select traits that are theoretically distinct.  
- Use meaningfully different methods (e.g., self-report, observer ratings, behavioral tasks).

### Evaluating Results

Check for:

- High reliability diagonals  
- Positive convergent validity  
- Proper ordering of correlations (Reliability > Convergent > HTHM)  
- Trait dominance over method effects (Mono-trait/hetero-method > Hetero-trait/mono-method)  
- Consistent hetero-method patterns  

### When Full MTMM Is Not Feasible

- Partial MTMM designs can still be informative.  
- Theoretical expectations about correlation patterns remain critical.  
- Limitations should be documented and addressed in future research.

---

## Conclusion

The MTMM framework operationalizes **construct validation** by making visible the contributions of **traits**, **methods**, and **error**. Grounded in **critical multiplism**, it encourages researchers to vary what they can, strengthening both generalizability and theoretical clarity. Even modest MTMM designs provide a powerful, transparent approach to validation.
